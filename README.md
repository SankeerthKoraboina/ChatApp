# Real-time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built using Node.js and Express. The project serves a basic Express server that listens on a configurable port and serves a simple "Hello World" message on the root URL. The chat functionality will be integrated as a future enhancement.

## Features

- Simple Express server setup
- Configurable port (default: 3000)
- Plans to integrate real-time chat using Socket.IO
